Type check
- TO DO: Primitive operations on arrays

Reduce functions:
- Copy function definition
- Unify types of formal parameters with actual parameters
- Replace references to formal parameters with actual parameter expressions

Get actual array sizes
- Reduce array size expressions. They should be constant, non-recursive.

Make sure array sizes are compatible
- Check that cases in array definitions have equal sizes
- Check the primitive operation arguments have qual sizes
- (Optional) Detect out-of-bounds accesses.
- (Optional) Automatically limit array size by infering maximum from array applications.

Continue as usual with array reduction ...

How to type check primitive operations on arrays?

If all operations apply to arrays just as well as primitive types, should we even have the array type?
