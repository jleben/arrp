fir-filter:
  Filter consists of map and reduce statements, both 2 dimensional
  First dimension corresponds to filter output,
  second dimension corresponds to inputs used for individual output.

  Scheduler picks diagonal (1,1) first scheduling hyperplane for both
  map and reduce stmts.
  This prevents parallelizing the independent pairs of map + reduction,
  because reductions are spread across the first hyperplane, which could otherwise
  be achieved with a simple (1,0) hyperplane.

  This allows parallelizing the second dimension (maps + reductions),
  which now carries no dependencies, but that's less benefit.

  Also, we could parallelize just the map step (in both dimensions!),
  but that would require buffering n^2 data before feeding into reductions.

fir-filter:
  When reduction domain is 1 less than its input domain,
  reduction is offset by 1 after its input in the enclosing schedule dimension.

fir-filter, spectral flux, multi-channel equalizer:
  Map not fused with reduce.
  This is not due to reduction being split into init and accum stmts.
  It is also not necessarily due to input stmt being contracted to 1 dimension.
  It seems it happens whenever input has less dimensions than the following
  stmts.

filter-bank:
  Statement with phase but no inter-period dependency!
